### Executive Summary

Some studies suggested that people living in poverty have shorter life spans. From the equity standpoint, everyone should have the basic right to survive. Therefore, it is important to examine elements that are associated with life expectancy, and governments have responsibilities to close the gap of the inequality in terms of developing and implementing public policies. 

This project evaluates how income, total and government health spending, improved drinking water source, food supply, and cancer death associate with life expectancy. The data of all variables are from the Gapminder. 

Pearson Correlation Coefficient and Multiple linear regression were used to infer causal relationships between life expectancy and independent variables used in this project. Income, improved drinking water source, and food supply are related to life expectancy based on these two tests. Although cancer death is not significantly correlated with life expectancy, it is statistically significant to the regression model. On the other hand, total and government health spending are correlated with life expectancy but not statistically significant to the regression model.
