#### What is the problem I want to solve?

*	I have been interested in how poverty affects people’s lives. 

* Through this dataset, I would like to know whether poor people live shorter from the global perspective?


* Does total health expenditure and government’s health expenditure help citizens live longer? 

* What kinds of cancer contribute more to shorter life expectancy?  I would like to look at common cancers including breast cancer, cervical cancer, colon and rectum cancer, lung cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, and prostate cancer. 


#### Who is my client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will my client DO or DECIDE based on my analysis that they wouldn’t have otherwise?

*	Government agencies, public health organizations, healthcare facilities, and medical professionals would be interested to know relationships between poverty, life expectancy, and cancer rate, in order to improve income inequality problem in terms of longevity and cancer rate in their countries, regions, and communities.


#### What data am I going to use for this? How will I acquire this data?

*	I am going to use data provided by Gapminder at http://www.gapminder.org/data/. 

* To search data related to my questions, I use keywords including life expectancy, income, health expenditure and death. 

* There are many health data available so I will focus on different types of cancer rate, in addition to life expectancy, income, and health expenditure. All variables stated previously in the “dataset” section will be used to study the relationship between income and life expectancy, whether government and overall health expenditures help improve life expectancy, and what kinds of cancer contribute more to shorter life expectancy.
