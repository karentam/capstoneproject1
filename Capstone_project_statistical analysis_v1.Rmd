# Apply Exploratory Data Analysis and Statistics to Capstone Project

This project studies whether there are any relationships between citizen's life expectancy of countries and variables including income, health expenditure, cancer deaths, food supply, and clean drinking water sources.

The dataset is from gapminder.org, the independent Swedish foundation, that produces free teaching resources making the world understandable based on reliable statistics from various sources, including World Bank, World Health Organization Global Health Expenditure Database, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Millennium Development Goals Indicators, Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Human Mortality Database, World Population Prospects (United Nations Population Division), Human Lifetable Database, and International Agency for Research on Cancer. 

### Density and Empirical Cumulative Density Function Plots:

#### GDP Per Capita 

Data of 273 countries from 1960 to 2011 is used in plots below. GDP per capital by country is not normally distributed. The mean of GDP Per Capita is $6,615.54, but the median is $1,895.99. The standard deviation is $10,671.26 which shows large difference of GDP Per Capita between countries. 

There are 1/3 of the countries with less than US$557 income per person. Nine of the ten countries with the lowest means of GDP Per Capita are from different parts of Africa. Nepal is the only one Asian country in the bottom ten list. 

Outliers are countries with citizens who have very high income in average ($80,000). The top five countries with the highest means of GDP Per Capita are small countries and territories in Western Europe. United Arab Emirates and Qatar in the Middle East, Japan in Asia, and United States in North America are among the top ten as well.

#### Life Expectancy 

Data of life expectancy was from 273 countries from 1960 to 2016. The mean of global life expectancy is 64.90 years, and the median is 67.60 years. The Standard deviation of life expectancy is 10.77 years, suggesting that the life expectancy of people in different countries do not have a dramatic difference. The data is left-skewed, suggesting that the majority of countries have longer life expectancy. 
Outliers are from countries with life expectancy of less than 30 years of age during wars. They include Mali in 1960 and 1961. Since gaining independence from France in 1960, the West African state of Mali has been afflicted by several rebellions, insurrections, and coups. Another outliers were created by the genocide in Cambodia from 1975 to 1980, that resulted in the deaths of 25% of the country's population from starvation, overwork and executions. Rwanda is one of these outliers as well due to the genocide in 1994. There were 500,000 to 1,000,000 deaths during that year.

#### Total Health Spending 

Data of total health spending was from 273 countries from 1995 to 2010. The mean is US$653, and the median is US$156. The standard deviation is $1,220.87 US Dollars per person, which shows a large difference between rich and poor countries. It is not normally distributed and is right-skewed. There are 3/4 of countries with the total health spending per person of US$564 or less. 

Outliers are countries with total health spending more than US$8,000 per person per year. There are 6 records in this subset. The countries are Luxembourg, Norway, and United States from 2008 to 2010. These are rich countries, and their annual expenses are from $8,054 to $8,361.

#### Government Health Spending 

Data of government health spending was from 273 countries from 1995 to 2010. The mean is US$460.63, and the median is US$87.67. The standard deviation of government health spending is $919.91 US Dollars per person, which has a slightly smaller difference between countries comparing to the total health spending. Similar to the total health spending, it is not normally distributed and is right-skewed. There are about 3/4 of the countries with the government health spending per person of US$460 or less. 

Outliers are Luxembourg and Norway from 2007 to 2010 with more than US$6,000 government health spending per person per year.

#### Improved Drinking Water Sources

Data of improved drinking water sources was from 273 countries from 1990 to 2010. The mean of population with improved drinking water sources in different countries is 83.68%, and the median is 91.00%. The standard deviation is 19.08%, meaning that there is a difference of the percent of population with clean drinking water sources between countries. The data is left-skewed, and there are about 2/3 of the countries with more than 90% of population using improved drinking water sources. 

Outliers are from Afghanistan in different years in 1990s with less than 10% of population using improved drinking water sources. In 2007, Afghanistan has improved the accessability to clean drinking water to 50% of its population.

#### Food Supply

Data of average daily intake was from 273 countries from 1961 to 2007. The mean of global average daily intake is 2,522 calories per day per person, and the median is 2,434 calories. According to the National Health Service, UK, the average male adult needs approximately 2,500 calories per day to keep his weight constant, while the average adult female needs 2,000 calories per day. In this regard, the mean and median are close to recommended daily calories intakes. The standard deviation is 522.26 calories per person per day, suggesting that calories intake in different countries does not have a large difference. 

There are only 6 countries with the average daily intake of less than 1,000 calories, but those are from 1960s to 1990s. Countries include China, Burkina Faso, Maldives in 1960s; Ethiopia and Djibouti in 1970s, and Eritrea in 1990s. Outliers are countries with 3,750 calories per day per person or more, including United States from 2002 to 2006, Hungary in 1987 and 1989, and Austria in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2006, and 2007.

#### Cancer Death

Data of various cancer death was from 174 countries in 2002. The most updated available data that fit the dataset used here is 2002's. The types of cancer include breast, cervical, liver, stomach, lung, and prostate. The mean is 99.76 deaths per 100,000 person, and the median is 98.51 deaths. Standard deviation is 30.87 deaths, suggesting that cancer deaths in different countries do not make a huge difference. The data is close to normally distributed but is still right-stewed. 

The outlier with 249.4 cancer deaths per 100,000 person per year in 2002 is Mongolia due to its extremely high rate of liver cancer (140.6 deaths per 100,000 person). Mongolia has the world's highest rate of liver cancer mortality. High rates of hepatitis C and B infection along with widespread alcohol use have left Mongolia with a burden of liver cancer that it is ill-equipped to handle.

### Scatter Plots:

#### Income vs Life Expectancy

Using data of 270 countries in 1960 and 2010, the plot shows that the higher the income, the longer life the person has. However, the difference of life expectancy between wealthy and poor countries is getting smaller in the most recent decades. 

The correlation of 0.58 in 2010 suggests that income and life expectancy have a moderate, positive relationship. The correlation of 0.75 in 1960 shows stronger positive relationship between income and life expectancy. It confirms that the gap of life expectancy between richer and poorer countries is getting closer.

However, there is a difference in life expectancy between countries on the same income level according to Professor Hans Rosling from Gapmider because it depends on how the money is distributed and how it is used. For example, Swaziland had $5,850 GDP Per Capita in 2002. However, the country had a much shorter life expectancy of 48 years. The reason was that 63% of Swazis lived below the national poverty line which was relatively high for a lower middle income country. 3.1 million people living with HIV was another public concern that affected the country's life expectancy.

#### Life Expectancy vs Total Health Spending / Government Health Spending

Using data of 273 countries in 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010, the plots show that the higher the total and government health spending, the longer people can live. 

Total Health Spending vs Life Expectancy: The correlations of 0.53 in 1995, 0.52 in 2000, 0.53 in 2005, and 0.54 in 2010 suggest that total health spending and life expectancy have a moderate, positive relationship. 

Government Health Spending vs Life Expectancy: The correlations of 0.52 in 1995, 0.52 in 2000, 0.51 in 2005, and 0.52 in 2010 suggest that government health spending and life expectancy also have a moderate, positive relationship. 

Generally speaking, country's citizens live longer with higher total health spending. However, there are a few outliers. For example, United States spent US$8,360 per person on health, which was more than other countries. But US citizen's life expectancy is a little shorter compared to other countries with the similar amount of health expenditure because of the large inequality in health spending.

#### Income, Life Expectancy, Total and Government Health Spending

Using data of 273 countries from 1995 to 2010, the pairs plot contains 12 graphs showing relationships between Income, Life Expectancy, Total and Government Health Spending. 

It is clear that the higher the income, the more the government and total health spending are. 

Again, it shows positive relationships between income and life expectancy, and between life expectancy and total/government health spending. 

![](https://github.com/karentam/capstoneproject1/blob/master/Pairs_IncomeLifeSpend_Log10.png?raw=true)

#### Life Expectancy vs Food Supply

Using data of 273 countries in 1997 and 2007, the plot suggests that not having enough calories intake can threaten people's lives. The correlations of 0.75 in 1997 and 0.68 in 2007 suggest that food supply and life expectancy have a strong, positive relationship. 

It is also reasonable that income may take a role between food supply and life expectancy. When people have money to buy enough food, they will no longer face the threat of starvation. On the other hand, proper nutrition also affects life expectancy by decreasing the chance of having preventable diseases.

#### Life Expectancy vs Clean Drinking Water Sources

Using data of 273 countries from 1997 to 2007, the plot shows the positive relationship between life expectancy and percentage of the total population using improved drinking water sources. The correlations of 0.79 in 1997 and 0.75 in 2007 suggest that improved drinking water sources and life expectancy have a strong, positive relationship. 

Improved drinking water sources include piped water into dwelling, plot or yard; public tap/standpipe; borehole/tube well; protected dug well; protected spring; rainwater collection and bottled water (if a secondary available source is also improved). 

The plot is created on square root scale. Plot created on Log 10 will have the similar look. There were 108 countries in 2007 and 97 countries in 1997 that reach more than 90%. So many points are located closed to 100%. 

![](https://github.com/karentam/capstoneproject1/blob/master/ScatterPlot_WaterLife_Sqrt_CI_2r.png?raw=true)

#### Life Expectancy vs Total Death of Various Cancer Types

Using data of 276 countries in 2002, the plot shows that there is a slight negative relationship between life expectancy and total cancer death. When cancer death increases, the length of life decreases. The total number of cancer death here includes breast, cervical, lung, liver, stomach, and prostate cancers. 

The correlation of -0.05 suggests that cancer death and life expectancy have a very weak, negative relationship. Cancer is not the major reason of death nowaday, especially in richer countries, because of widespread screening programs that detect cancers at early and treatable stage.
