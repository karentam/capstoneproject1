### Scatter Plots:


#### Income vs Life Expectancy

The plot shows that the higher the income, the longer life the person has. However, the difference of life expectancy between wealthy and poor countries is getting smaller in the most recent decade.

#### Life Expectancy vs Total Health Spending / Government Health Spending

The plots show that the higher the total and government health spending, the longer people can live.

![](https://github.com/karentam/capstoneproject1/blob/master/ScatterPlot_GovSpendLife_Log10.png?raw=true)

#### Income, Life Expectancy, Total and Government Health Spending

The plot contains 12 graphs showing relationships between Income, Life Expectancy, Total and Government Health Spending. 

It is clear that the higher the income, the more the government and total health spending are. 

It also shows positive relationships between income and life expectancy, and between life expectancy and total/government health spending. But these relationships are not so clear, meaning that people from different countries live in a certain range of years, except cases of wars and natural disasters.

#### Life Expectancy vs Food Supply

The plot suggests that not having enough calory intake can threaten people's lives. It also suggests that income may take a role between food supply and life expectancy. When people have money to buy enough food, they will no longer face the threat of starvation.

#### Life Expectancy vs Clean Drinking Water Sources

The plot also shows the positive relationship between life expectancy and percentage of the total population using the improved drinking water sources. Improved drinking water sources include piped water into dwelling, plot or yard; public tap/standpipe; borehole/tube well; protected dug well; protected spring; rainwater collection and bottled water (if a secondary available source is also improved). 

The plot is created on square root scale. Plot created on Log 10 will have the similar look. There were 108 countries in 2007 and 97 countries in 1997 that reaches more than 90%. So many points are located closed to 100%.

#### Life Expectancy vs Total Death of Various Cancer Types

The plot shows that there is a slight negative relationship between life expectancy and total cancer death. When cancer death increases, the length of life decreases. The total number of cancer death here includes breast, cervical, lung, liver, stomach, and prostate cancers. 

The major reason of its slight negative relationship is that cancer is just one of the many factors that affects life expectancy of countries.

#### Life Expectancy vs Different Types of Cancer Deaths

The plot shows that the longer life the country people, the less the death numbers of cervical and liver cancers are. 

On the other hand, it does not show a clear relationship between life expectancy and prostate cancer death, and between life expectancy and breast cancer death. Prostate and breast cancers have high survival rates if they are diagnosed and treated at early stage. 

It is interesting that it shows positive relationships between life expectancy and lung cancer death, and between life expectancy and stomach cancer death. There may be other unknown variables that connect them together.

#### Life Expectancy vs Breast Cancer Deaths

The plot shows the very slight increase in the year of life when the number of breast cancer deaths goes up. It possibly shows that breast cancer death itself does not closely related to the general life expectancy in countries.

![](https://github.com/karentam/capstoneproject1/blob/master/ScatterPlot_BreastCLife_Log10.png?raw=true)

#### Life Expectancy vs Cervical Cancer Deaths

On the other hand, this plot shows the higher the cervical cancer death number, the shorter people live. The strongest negative relationship is shown in 2002.

![](https://github.com/karentam/capstoneproject1/blob/master/ScatterPlot_CervicalCLife_Log10.png?raw=true)


#### Life Expectancy vs Lung Cancer Deaths

Similar to breast cancer death, the plot does not show close relationship between life expectancy and lung cancer death. It possibly shows that lung cancer death itself does not closely related to the general life expectancy in countries. 

![](https://github.com/karentam/capstoneproject1/blob/master/ScatterPlot_LungCLife_Log10.png?raw=true)

#### Life Expectancy vs Liver Cancer Deaths

The plots do not show strong relationship between life expecancy and liver cancer death from 1987 to 1997. However, in 2002, the higher the liver cancer death number, the shorter people live.  

![](https://github.com/karentam/capstoneproject1/blob/master/ScatterPlot_LiverCLife_Log10.png?raw=true)


#### Life Expectancy vs Prostate Cancer Deaths

The plots do not show strong relationship between life expectancy and prostate cancer death. It possibly shows that prostate cancer death itself does not closely related to the general life expectancy in countries. 

![](https://github.com/karentam/capstoneproject1/blob/master/ScatterPlot_ProstateCLife_Log10.png?raw=true)


#### Life Expectancy vs Stomach Cancer Deaths

The plots show the slight negative relationship from 1987 to 1997 and very slight positive relationship in 2002 between life expectancy and stomach center death. It possibly shows that stomach cancer death itself does not closely related to the general life expectancy in countries.
